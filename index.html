    <h1>Jake Stonebraker</h1>
    <p>I am a 4th year Computer Science major at New Mexico State University. I was born in San Diego, California to two immigrant
      parents who both came from the Philippines. I graduated from Mar Vista High School in Imperial Beach, California. <br> <br>
      I'm a computer science student with a passion for coding and technology. With one semester left before graduation, I’ve worked on
      a variety of projects, including web development, algorithm design, and IoT applications. I’m always looking for opportunities
      to expand my skills and explore new areas in tech. When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about the latest trends in software
      development and working on personal projects.
