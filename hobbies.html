      <h2>Video Games</h2>
      <p>I know I can always count on video games to be my escape from the stress that everyday life brings. When I do have the
        free time, I enjoy playing Call of Duty Multiplayer and Call of Duty: Warzone. I even enjoy streaming on Twitch from time
        to time. Enjoy one of my many gameplays below</p>

      <h2>My Favorite Teams</h2>
      <p>I grew up around sports. From playing to watching, they will always hold a special place in my life.</p>

      <div class="favorite-team">
        <h3>San Diego Padres</h3>
        <p>Being born and raised in San Diego, I grew up watching Padres games for as long as I can remember. My dad used to always take me and
        my brother to the ballpark, and it has become one of my favorite pastimes even to this day. One day, I hope to do the same for
        my future children.</p>

      <div class="favorite-team">
        <h3>Los Angeles Chargers</h3>
        <p>My admiration for the Chargers dates back to when I was just 5 years old. During that time, they were still in San Diego.
        I would say that being a Chargers fan is a love/hate relationship, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. The future
        looks bright with Justin Herbert at quarterback and Jim Harbaugh at the helm.</p>

      <div class="favorite-team">
        <h3>Los Angeles Lakers</h3>
        <p>While my older relatives had Michael Jordan, I had Kobe Bryant to look up to as a basketball player myself. His last
        championship in 2010 against the Celtics in 7 games is definitely one for the history books. I am proud to be a Lakers fan
        for life.</p>
